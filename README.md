# ENPM661--Project-2
Repository containing the code for ENPM661 - Project 2. Implementation of Dijkstra algorithm

To run the code, download both Dijkstra_rigid.py and Dijkstra_point.py for rigid and point robots respectively.

When you run Dijkstra_rigid.py, you will get an input request to input radius and clearance. The cumulative value of which is expected to be 10.

The start and goal positions have been defined in the code as per the requirements of the submission.

Image of the backtracking path is shown below with blue representing the explored nodes and the red line showing the backtracking path.
