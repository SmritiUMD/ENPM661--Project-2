Repository containing the code for ENPM661 - Project 2. Implementation of Dijkstra algorithm

To run the code, download both Dijkstra_rigid.py and Dijkstra_point.py for rigid and point robots respectively.
Dependencies- numpy, queue, time, cv2

When you run Dijkstra_rigid.py, you will get an input request to input radius and clearance. 

The start and goal positions have been defined in the code.

Image of the backtracking path is shown below with blue path representing the Shortest path and the red line showing the explored nodes.
